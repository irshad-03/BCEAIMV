# BCEAIMV
A frame work for validating the 'ai' model.

Blockchain for Ethical AI Model Validation (B-EAIMV)

Project Objective
This project validates whether the answers generated by FactSpeak AI (a fact-based Q&A system) are truthful. Each validation result is then recorded immutably on a blockchain for transparency and accountability.

System Components
AI Model (FactSpeak AI): Provides factual answers to user questions.

Verifier: A script/tool that checks the truthfulness of answers using trusted references (e.g., Wikipedia, GPT, or web search).

Blockchain Logger: Smart contract + Python script to store validation results permanently.

Implementation Workflow
Ask & Answer

User inputs a factual question.

FactSpeak AI generates an answer.

Validate Answer

The verifier checks if the AI’s response is truthful by comparing it against trusted data sources.

Blockchain Logging

A smart contract records:

Question

AI Answer

Truthfulness verdict (✅ True / ❌ False)

Timestamp

Validator info (optional)

(Optional) Real-Time Interface

GUI/CLI to:

Ask questions

Display AI answers

Log results on blockchain

Why Blockchain?
Creates an immutable log of every AI validation.
Ensures transparency, trust, and reproducibility.
Can be extended with auditor signatures or trust scores for higher accountability.
